Cell phone towersabc form an important component of the mobile phone infrastructure network. Acting like an antenna, the cell phone 
tower picks up the call from the cell phone and transmits it to the receiver. These days, their presence everywhere indicates that so long as the demand for 
wireless service continues, the need for cell phone towers will also continue. With the proliferation of cell phones, the towers are playing a crucial role in 
carrying signals from one phone to another and companies are setting up state-of-the-art infrastructure to provide quality service to the consumers, 
even in sparsely populated remote areas.
But all this could change in the future, for balloons are soon to be tested as replacements for costly cell phone towers! 
Balloons for cellular coverage… sounds weird? Balloons will carry wireless network repeaters high above in the skies to fill the gaps in cellular coverage 
in thinly populated areas.
Former governor of North Dakota, US, and head of Extend America Inc., Ed Schafer, says the idea works perfectly in the lab. 
Extend America and Chandler, Arizona-based Space Data Corporation, are developing the technology, which is said to be the first to use disposable 
balloons to provide cellular coverage that requires a tiny fraction of the cost of building cellular towers.  Three balloons would cover the entire state of 
North Dakota as compared to 1,100 cell phone towers necessary to provide this service. If the trials are successful, then hydrogen-filled balloons would be 
launched into the stratosphere above North Dakota. 
The balloon technology called ‘SkySite’ is already in use in places such as Texas, Oklahoma, Louisiana, Arkansas and New Mexico in 
applications including tracking oil company vehicles and monitoring the production of oil wells and pipelines. Jerry Knoblach, CEO, Space Data, says 
that the balloons would work in North Dakota even in cold or stormy weather. Up to 20 miles above the earth, above the path of commercial airliners, 
stratospheric winds would push the balloons across the state at about 30 mph. Each balloon would deliver voice and data service in an area hundreds of miles 
in diameter. Nine balloons would always be in the air. After gaining altitude, the balloons would swell from six feet in diameter to 30 feet. Once a balloon 
leaves the state, its communications pod would jettison, deploy a parachute and fall to earth, where it would signal its position. This would be sent again 
after a new battery pack is put. After the electronic equipment is released, the balloons rise and expand with the drop in air pressure until they 
burst.
